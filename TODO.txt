Fix SEDTARGETDATE thing
Change scratch to hadoop skimming location when putting on condor

condor infrastructure
fake/double reco/ secondary code
job exit code
save original skim to hadoop and put an option to bypass the initial skim (only run iteration steps)
jet information maybe?
possible need to specify trkStatus for things?
trkDensity fine binning added to config file (currently hardcoded in iterate.c)
