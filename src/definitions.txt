everything reco is first required to pass highPurity (and any other cuts)
These are my working definitions, the Fake might be slightly different than the standard definition but can be used to obtain the standard definition w/ simple arithmetic



Efficiency is defined as the % of gen particles reconstructed as 
            primary tracks matched any gen particle (should be between 0-1)

Secondary is the ratio of matched 2ndary tracks to all matched tracks (>0 but small)

Fake Rate is defined as the ratio of all reco'd tracks to all reco'd tracks w/ any gen particle matched to it (should be above 1)

Multiple reco is the number of reco'd tracks that are matched to an already 'taken' gen track, divided by the number of gen particles having matched tracks (should be >=0 and is usually tiny)



The total correction is then

measured/Fake = measured spectra that would be matched
measured*(1-Secondary)/(Fake) = measured spectra that would be primary matched
measured*(1-Secondary)/(Fake*(1+Multiple)) =  measured spectra that is primary matched and not a result of multiple reco
measured*(1-Secondary)/(Fake*(1+Multiple)*Eff) = corrected to the 'gen spectra'
